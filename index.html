            <h1>Our Objectives</h1>
            <p>SEDA assists applicants graduating from high school aspiring to jumpstart their career, students completing their further Education and Training seeking to fasttrack their career trajectory, and students working for a few years looking to break the 'glass ceiling'.</p>

                    <h3>Promote a sense of belonging</h3>
                    <p>Utilizing strengths-based inclusive approaches, like those in our Inclusive Practice Hub, fosters an environment where every student feels appreciated and backed by both faculty and peers. Consequently, students are more inclined to strengthen their sense of belonging, engage more with the school community, and experience enhanced self-confidence, motivation, and enthusiasm for learning, pursuing their passions, and succeeding academically.</p>

                    <h3>Creating a safe and predictable environment</h3>
                    <p>Clear structures, routines, and safe spaces are vital for students facing mental health issues or past trauma. These organized environments promote student autonomy, reduce stress, and enhance emotional well-being. Strategies include establishing predictable daily routines and employing a fair and positive approach to behavior management.</p>

                    <h3>Promoting family-school partnership</h3>
                    <p>UActive family involvement in education positively impacts students' self-esteem, school connection, adjustment, academic performance, and overall well-being. Collaborative relationships between families and schools contribute to consistent support for students at home and in school. Continuous communication among educators, families, and relevant community members fosters a shared comprehension of a student's strengths, abilities, and welfare. These meaningful partnerships enhance stability, identify potential areas of concern, and facilitate the provision of necessary support or intervention when needed.</p>

                    <p>Secure, respectful, and reciprocal relationships lead to studentsâ€™ increased engagement in learning, prosocial behaviour, feelings of safety at school, and reduced depression, anxiety and stress. </p>
